# SortingVisualizer
This project is a web-based application that allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. The application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive platform where users can generate random arrays of numbers and observe how different sorting algorithms rearrange the elements to put them in order. The visualizations help users better understand how sorting algorithms work and how their efficiency varies.


Features
Generate random arrays of various sizes.
Visualize the following sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Selection Sort.
Adjustable sorting speed to observe the process at different rates.
Real-time visualization on a canvas element.
